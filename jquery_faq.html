    <li>How old is the National Park System?
        The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established by an act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park. View the National Park System timeline.</li>
    <li>What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?
        The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological values. Read more about the history of the arrowhead and other elements of NPS visual design.
    </li>
    <li>How many areas are in the National Park System?
        The system includes 418 areas covering more than 85 million acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House. Learn more about national park designations. See the complete list of National Park Service units and affiliated areas by type and number.

    <li>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?
        Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass.

    <li>Where can I find a park map?
        You can view maps on specific park websites or download maps from the Harpers Ferry Center map collection.

    </li>
    <li>How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?
        For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this service; many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check specific park websites. You can also learn more about camping in national parks and find a map of parks with camping opportunities.</li>
    <li>Can I bring my pet to a national park?
        Some national parks welcome pets—in developed areas, on many trails and campgrounds, and in some lodging facilities. Learn more about pets in parks.

    <h3>Glacier National Park</h3>
    <li>1. Glacier National Park is a part of the world’s first international peace park. The vision for a park was to celebrate peace and friendship between the United States and Canada. In 1932 Glacier and Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberton, Canada, were designated the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. Today, the parks collaborate seamlessly in their preservation, fire management, and research efforts. Learn more about Glacier’s international designations.
    </li>
    <li>2. Glacier straddles the Continental Divide, allowing for extreme weather. That’s because the opposing Pacific and Arctic airs meet at the Divide, creating a dramatic clash of weather. In one instance just outside the park’s eastern boundary in Browning, Montana, the temperature was noted as dropping 100 degrees in just 24 hours. When heading out for a day in the park, be sure to bring rain gear and extra clothes.

    </li>
    <li>3. Going-to-the-Sun Road is a spectacular marvel and a must see on your trip to Glacier. Going-to-the-Sun Road connects the east and west sides through the middle of the park, crossing the Continental Divide at Logan Pass. Covering 50 miles of awe-inspiring landscapes, glaciers, and cascading waterfalls, this drive is certainly a quintessential part of your visit.

    </li>
    <li>4. Evidence of human use in the area dates back over 12,000 years. Archeological evidence shows human occupation of this landscape dating back to the retreat of the Ice Age glaciers 12,000 years ago. These mountains still hold spiritual significance for the local Blackfeet, Salish, and Kootenai Tribes.
